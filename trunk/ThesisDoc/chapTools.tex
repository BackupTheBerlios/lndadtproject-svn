\section {Sun SPOTs} \label{sec:sunspots}

Sensor nodes, as mentioned in Section \ref{subsec:sensornodes}, are
characterised by limited resources, including memory. 

In order to overcome memory limitations, wireless sensor network applications
have traditionally been coded in non-managed languages like C and assembly
language \cite{simon_squawk:2006}.
 
Managed runtime languages like Java were not used for sensor network programming
because of the combination of the static memory footprint of the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) and the dynamic memory footprint of the WSN application code.
 
On the other hand, it is widely accepted that development times are greatly reduced
upon the use of managed runtime languages such as Java
\cite{simon_squawk:2006}. Therefore, currently prevalent WSN programming practice
trades developer efficiency for memory efficiency. 

However, Simon et al \cite{simon_squawk:2006} state the benefits resulted from
using a managed runtime language for WSN programming as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Simplification of the process of WSN programming, that would cause an
  increase in developer adoption rates and productivity.
  \item Opportunity to use standard development and debugging tools.
\end{itemize}

The use of the Java programming language in SunSPOTs makes it particularly
suitable as a platform for the DADT applications presented. This is because the
DADT programming abstraction is designed to reduce programmer workload, and the
use of a managed runtime language such as Java has been shown to further
improve developer efficiency.
 
\subsection{The Sun SPOT hardware platform }
Sun Microsystems has, on the basis of the arguments discussed in the previous
section, proposed and built a sensor device
called the Sun Small Programmable Object Technology (Sun SPOT) that uses a
on-board JVM to allow for WSN programming using Java.

The Sun SPOT (see Figure \ref{Fig:SunSpot}) uses an ARM-9 processor, has 512 KB of RAM
and 4 MB of flash memory, uses a 2.4GHz radio with an integrated antenna on the board. The radio
is a TI CC2420 and is IEEE 802.15.4 compliant.

\subsection{The Squawk JVM}

The Squawk JVM is used on Sun SPOTs to enable on-board execution of Java
programs. The Squawk VM was originally developed for a smart card system with
even greater memory constraints than the Sun SPOTs. The Squawk JVM has the
following features \cite{simon_squawk:2006}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item It is written in Java, and specifically designed for resource
  constrained devices, meeting the requirements of Connected Limited Device
  Configuration 1.1 (CLDC) framework for Java Micro Edition (Java ME)
  applications.
  \item It does not require an underlying OS as it runs directly on the Sun
  SPOT hardware. This allows for a reduction in memory consumption.
  \item It suuports inter-device application migration.
  \item It allows the execution of multiple applications on one VM,
  representing each one as an object.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Split VM Architecture}

As resource constrained devices are incapable of loading class files on-device
by virtue of their limited memory, a VM architecture known as the ``split VM
architecture'' is used, as shown in Figure
\ref{Fig:SquawkVM_architecture}.

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[scale=0.61]{img/Squawk_architecture.eps} 
\caption[The Squawk Split VM Architecture]{The Squawk
Split VM Architecture (reproduced from \cite{simon_squawk:2006})}
\label{Fig:SquawkVM_architecture}
\end{figure}  

The Squawk split VM architecture uses a class file preprocessor known as the
\emph{suite creator} that converts the \emph{.class} bytecode into a more
compact representation called the Squawk bytecode. According to
\cite{simon_squawk:2006}, Squawk bytecodes are optimised in order to:
\begin{itemize}
\item minimise space used by using smaller bytecode representation, escape
mechanisms for float and double instructions, and widened operands. 
\item enable in-place execution, by ``resolving symbolic references to other
classes, data members, and member functions into direct pointers, object offsets
and method table offsets respectively''.
\item simplify garbage collection, by the careful reallocation of local
variables, and by storing on the operand stack the operands of only those instructions that would result in a memory allocation.
\end{itemize}

The Squawk bytecodes are converted into a \emph{.suite} file created by
serialising and saving into a file the internal object memory representation.
These files are loaded on to the device, and subsequently interpreted by the
on-device VM.

\subsection{Sun SPOT applications} \label{subsec:sunspotapps}

Sun SPOT applications are divided into two classes:
\cite{sun_developer:2008}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{On-SPOT applications}
  \item \emph{On-Host applications}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/SunSPOTS_applications.eps} 
\caption[Types of Sun SPOT applications]{Types of Sun SPOT applications (adapted from
\cite{sun_developer:2008})}
\label{Fig:SunSPOTS_applications}
\end{figure}  

\emph{On-SPOT applications}  are deployed and
executed on a remote Sun SPOT that communicates untethered. On-SPOT
applications are Java programs that runs on the Squawk VM, and is compliant
with CLDC 1.1 specification. 

\emph{On-Host applications} run on the host machine
(typically a PC), and communicate with the network of Sun SPOTs through a base
station node that serves no purpose other than to facilitate Sun SPOT-host
machine communication. 
  
The base station node, which is a Sun SPOT itself, communicates with other
nodes in the network using RF communication, and with the host machine via a
USB link (see Figure \ref{Fig:SunSPOTS_applications}). The host application is
a Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) program.
  
 
\section{Summary}

This chapter presented an overview of the concepts, technologies, and hardware
underlying the work presented in this thesis. After underlining the need for the
use of programming models to increase the ubiquity of WSN use, this chapter
introduced a taxonomy of programming abstractions and placed the Distributed
Abstract Data Types programming abstraction used in this work within the
framework of the taxonomy. This was followed by a detailed discussion on Abstract
and Distributed Abstract Data Types used in the application layer of the
prototype produced during the course of this work, and the Logical Neighbourhood
routing mechanism used in the network and data link layers of the prototype. The
chapter concluded with a brief presentation of the SunSPOTs hardware platform,
and its particular suitability for the application under consideration.
