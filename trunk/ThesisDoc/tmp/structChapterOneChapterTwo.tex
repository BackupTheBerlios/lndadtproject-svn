\section{Structure of Introduction}

Quick one paragraph description of what you're doing.

\subsection{Problem statement}

\begin{itemize}
\item Programming abstractions for WSNs, why they're required.
\item ADTs and DADTs provide these abstractions.
\item However prototype of DADTs limited:
\subitem Require efficient routing instead of IP multicast
\subitem Require efficient network-layer scoping mechainsm.
\subitem Requires extensions to real nodes.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Our contribution}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use of novel logical neighbourhood-based mechanism for routing and scoping.
\item Integrating the prototype to run on the JiST simulator.
\item Extension of prototype to use real hardware, namely Java-based SunSpots.
\end{itemize}
