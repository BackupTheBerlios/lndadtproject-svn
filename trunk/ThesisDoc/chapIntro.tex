\chapter{Introduction}

\textcolor{green}{Jo: quote is fine, but better Sth Like : Mark Weiser once
wrote in his visionary paper from whenever [22]:}

\begin{quote}
\emph{The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave
themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable
from it} (Mark Weiser)

\end{quote}

Recent progress in micro system technologies and wireless communication
made it possible to deploy wireless sensor networks (WSNs) that contain a large
number of sensor nodes, multifunctional devices characterised by their low- cost,
low-power, and small form factor, that can communicate across short distances
using Radio Frequency (RF) communication \cite{SensorSurveyAkyildiz:2002}.

WSNs are being used in a wide range of applications in military and civilian
operations such as, for instance, health monitoring, environment monitoring,
data acquisition in dangerous environments, and target tracking.
