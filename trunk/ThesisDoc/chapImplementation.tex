\section{Contribution}

\cite{migliavacca_DADT:2006} presented a prototype that enabled the use of DADTs
to facilitate distributed application programming. While this approach is
clearly applicable to WSNs, the prototype itself did not support WSN
abstractions, and there were several limitations to it:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The lack of a routing mechanism.
  \item Limitations in portability to real WSN nodes.
\end{itemize}

This work makes the following contributions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Extension of the DADT prototype for use in WSNs by extending it to run
  on simulators as well as devices in a real-world environment.
  \item Interfacing the LN mechanism presented in \cite{mottola_LNAbstraction}
  to enable abstracted communication between groups of nodes in the WSN defined
  by DADTs.
  \item  Verification of the utility of DADT abstractions in the WSN application
  layer.
\end{itemize}

\section{The DADT/LN Architecture}

% FILL THIS IN LATER.
\subsection{Overview}

application workflow]{Workflow for development of an application that uses
the DADT/LN prototype}
\end{figure} 
The overview of the workflow involved in using DADTs to enable WSN application
programming is as shown in Figure \ref{Fig:DADTLN_architecture}. The user writes
application layer code for the WSN using a DADT language in a series of
\emph{.dadt} files. A preprocessor is used to convert the code written by the
application programmer into Java code that interfaces with the DADT
infrastructure (extended from the prototype presented in
\cite{migliavacca_DADT:2006}). In order to facilitate routing to LNs defined by
the use of DADT views, the DADT infrastructure is interfaced with the a
previously developed implementation of LNs. 

The application (including the implementation of layers lower in the protocol
stack) is then loaded on to either:
\begin{itemize}
\item the JiST/SWANS simulator \cite{barr_JIST:2005, barr_SWANS}. See Section \ref{sec:jistswans} for details on the implementation of
the aforementioned simulator
\item a collection of Sun SPOT wireless sensor devices \cite{simon_squawk:2006}
(see Section \ref{sec:sunspots}) to execute the application on real sensor nodes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Explanation of terms used}

]{Schematic Representation of the WSN as abstracted in the DADT/LN prototype}

\end{figure} 

This section explains the terms used in the DADT/LN prototype developed as part
of this work. The WSN network in this prototype consists of two types of
devices as shown in Figure \ref{Fig:DADTLN_glossary}: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Controller:} Typically PC-based, this node contains in the
  application layer the client node, the expression tree, the DADT instance, the
  DADT manager; the LN
  implementation is used in the network layer. The user's application code resides on
  the controller node.
  \item \emph{Sensor Device:} This is a sensor device such as a Sun SPOT, and
  holds the following entities:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Application Layer:} It includes a Sensor Node that in turn
    consists of multiple sensor ADT instances, and an ADT manager.
    \item \emph{Network Layer:} The LN implementation is used.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Execution Details}

This section attempts to explain the operation of the DADT/LN prototype
developed as part of this work by considering the sequence of method calls made
during execution. The operation of the simulation platform as well as the
nodes itself is abstracted from the explanations that follow, as is the actual
\emph{.dadt} syntax used by the application programmer himself to trigger these
operations. 

\subsubsection{The DADT/LN prototype on the Controller}

Figure \ref{Fig:SeqDiagram_Sensornode} presents the operation of the DADT/LN
prototype on the controller (which is typically PC-based). As shown in the figure, the implementation running on each sensor node 
consists of the following entities:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Client Node:} A Client Node is an abstraction that consists of a
  DADT instance. The application programmer's requests to the network are issued
  by the Client Node.
  \item \emph{DADT Instance:} A DADT Instance is explained in Section
  \ref{subsubsec:dadtspecandinst}, and allows for collective access to multiple
  ADT instances.
  \item \emph{Expression Tree:} An expression tree is a specific construct that is to
  build a hierarchical data view.
  \item \emph{DADT Manager:} The DADT Manager provides the interface between the
  Client Node and the network, and passes request messages from the Client Node
  to the lower layers of the protocol stack.
  \item \emph{Data View:} Data views are explained in Section
  \ref{subsubsec:views}, and is a mechanism for partitioning the collection of
  ADT instances bound to a particular DADT type.
  

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The DADT/LN prototype on the sensor node}

Figure \ref{Fig:SeqDiagram_Sensornode} presents the operation of the DADT/LN
prototype on the sensor node (which may be either simulated or a real
device). As shown in the figure, the implementation running on each sensor node 
consists of the following entities:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Sensor Node:} A sensor node is an abstraction that consists of a
  list of sensors. This follows from the example used to illustrate the concept
  of ADTs in Section \ref{sec:DADT}\footnote{The term \emph{device} is used to
  refer to the physical sensor node entity, while the term \emph{sensor node}
  refers to the application layer abstraction of all of the sensors within the
  device. This abstraction resides on the device.}
  \item \emph{Sensor ADT instance:} This is an ADT instance for a given sensor
  on the sensor node upon which the prototype executes. 
  \item \emph{ADT Manager:} The ADT manager provides the interface between the
  sensor node and the network, thereby abstracting sensor ADT instances from
  queries issued by the DADT instance at the (PC-based) controller.
\end{itemize}

Sensor ADT instance intialisation is performed possibly
multiple times
on a given Sensor Node, as a node might consist of multiple sesnsors. Following
this, the sensor ADT instances are bound to a particular DADT type by calling
the ADT manager\footnote{The ADT manager is assumed in our
current implementation to be aware of all DADT types defined in the WSN.}.

When the lower layer (which runs the LN algorithm) delivers a message to the
Sensor Node, the ADT Manager is used to processed the request message.The
request message contains a DADT Data view (see Section \ref{subsubsec:views})
which is used to filter from the sensor ADT instances on the given Sensor node
those that fit into the Data view. % DOUBLE PROCESSING. YOU KNOW. I SUGGEST GET% RID OF IT.

\emph{N.B.: If the request message is received in the application layer, then at least
one of the sensor ADT instances in the Sensor Node fits into the dataview, as
the data view is expressed in the form of an LN predicate. This minimises the
number of messages received at the application layer. However, since a given
Sensor Node may contain several sensor ADT instances, the ADT instances have to
be filtered.}

The request message also contains a description of the DADT action to be
performed on-device (see Section
\ref{subsubsec:OperatorsAndActions}). The ADT manager calls the action for each
sensor ADT instance that fits into the DADT Data view. 

If the application layer requires that a reply be sent, the LN implementation in
the lower layer of the protocol stack is used as can be seen on the bottom right
section of Figure \ref{Fig:SeqDiagram_Sensornode}.
